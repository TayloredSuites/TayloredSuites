### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

With an engineering background, my transition into data analysis has been technically hitch free. I have learned about data analysis and have some repositories to show a bit of that. My favored tools of the trade are Jupyter Notebook, PostgeSQL, Python, and its libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, and the ubiquitous Matplotlib. I am currently working on more projects to showcase my learning development. I am open to collaborations on projects and internships, as well as suggestions and input on my repositories.

Entering the tech world has been a priority for me in the last year, and here I am, data analyst and machine learning enthusiast.

Ask me more about my skills if you are in need of:

- a remote ERP administrator/consultant
- data analyst 
- or ghost writer

Those are my superpowers for now. Although you may be more interested in reading my anime reviews or keeping track of my android development progress ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
